# Reverse Shell Research

## To - Do
- Work on connection handling
    - take input from user to fill database for info about connection
    - connection in background running on threads in the background
    - netcat listeners for each victim running on startup
    - when execute the bash script it will auto connect to running listener
- Manage shell
    - shell of each victim pop up or one shell in program
- add other later when functionality is there
- Create our own method for these reverse shells
